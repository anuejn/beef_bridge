# BEEF BRIDGE

An IGBT-half-bridge-board that can handle High Voltages (450V) and high current (15A Hot, 30A Cold).

The board also features a LC-lowpass-filter, that has a cutoff frequency of about 20khz. The purpose of this board is to serve as the Power-Stage of a beefy class-d audio amplifier.

The design is open hardware and licensed under CERN-OHL-S.
